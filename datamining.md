## Data Mining 
The data mining tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of data mining. Our data mining tutorial is designed for learners and experts.

Data mining is one of the most useful techniques that help entrepreneurs, researchers, and individuals to extract valuable information from huge sets of data. Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). The knowledge discovery process includes Data cleaning, Data integration, Data selection, Data transformation, Data mining, Pattern evaluation, and Knowledge presentation.

Our Data mining tutorial includes all topics of Data mining such as applications, Data mining vs Machine learning, Data mining tools, Social Media Data mining, Data mining techniques, Clustering in data mining, Challenges in Data mining, etc.

## What is Data Mining?
The process of extracting information to identify patterns, trends, and useful data that would allow the business to take the data-driven decision from huge sets of data is called Data Mining.

In other words, we can say that Data Mining is the process of investigating hidden patterns of information to various perspectives for categorization into useful data, which is collected and assembled in particular areas such as data warehouses, efficient analysis, data mining algorithm, helping decision making and other data requirement to eventually cost-cutting and generating revenue.

Data mining is the act of automatically searching for large stores of information to find trends and patterns that go beyond simple analysis procedures. Data mining utilizes complex mathematical algorithms for data segments and evaluates the probability of future events. Data Mining is also called Knowledge Discovery of Data (KDD).

Data Mining is a process used by organizations to extract specific data from huge databases to solve business problems. It primarily turns raw data into useful information.

Data Mining is similar to Data Science carried out by a person, in a specific situation, on a particular data set, with an objective. This process includes various types of services such as text mining, web mining, audio and video mining, pictorial data mining, and social media mining. It is done through software that is simple or highly specific. By outsourcing data mining, all the work can be done faster with low operation costs. Specialized firms can also use new technologies to collect data that is impossible to locate manually. There are tonnes of information available on various platforms, but very little knowledge is accessible. The biggest challenge is to analyze the data to extract important information that can be used to solve a problem or for company development. There are many powerful instruments and techniques available to mine data and find better insight from it.
Why is data mining important?
## Data mining is a crucial component of successful analytics initiatives in organizations. The information it generates can be used in business intelligence (BI) and advanced analytics applications that involve analysis of historical data, as well as real-time analytics applications that examine streaming data as it's created or collected.

Effective data mining aids in various aspects of planning business strategies and managing operations. That includes customer-facing functions such as marketing, advertising, sales and customer support, plus manufacturing, supply chain management, finance and HR. Data mining supports fraud detection, risk management, cybersecurity planning and many other critical business use cases. It also plays an important role in healthcare, government, scientific research, mathematics, sports and more.
## How Data Mining Works
Data mining works through the concept of predictive modeling. Suppose an organization wants to achieve a particular result. By analyzing a dataset where that result is known, data mining techniques can, for example, build a software model that analyzes new data to predict the likelihood of similar results. Here’s an overview:

## Start with historical data

Let’s say a company wants to know the best customer prospects in a new marketing database. It starts by examining its own customers.

## Analyze the historical data

Software scans the collected data using a combination of algorithms from statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, looking for patterns and relationships in the data.

## Write rules

Once the patterns and relationships are uncovered, the software expresses them as rules. A rule might be that most customers ages 51 to 65 shop twice a week and fill their baskets with fresh foods, while customers ages 21 to 50 tend to shop once a week and buy more packaged food.

## Apply the rules

Here, the data mining model is applied to a new marketing database. If the company is a packaged food provider, it will be looking for 21- to 50-year-olds.

## What Can Data Mining Do?
Data mining finds hidden relationships and patterns in data that human analysts and other analysis techniques are likely to miss. The insights it reveals can help a business make better decisions, increasing revenue or making marketing more efficient, for example. But it’s important to understand that data mining finds patterns, not causal relationships. It doesn’t reduce an organization’s need for analysts who know the business, understand the data and are knowledgeable about data mining techniques and processes. Only such experts can assess the value of the patterns that data mining discovers and put them to good use on behalf of a business.

## Why Is Data Mining Important?
More products are becoming digital, as are more payment transactions and customer interactions. As this happens, more companies are finding that their data, often already stored in a data warehouse waiting to be analyzed, is just as valuable as their products and services. In this context, data mining gives companies a competitive edge by helping to rapidly find business insights hidden in all the data from all those digital business transactions. The benefits are almost endless. Understanding customer behaviors can lead to new product, service or marketing ideas. Detecting intrusions can prevent a devastating theft of customer data.

##Who Uses Data Mining?
Any company can use data mining, but those with large data sets will get more reliable results. The patterns and relationships discovered with thousands of customers are more likely to accurately predict future customer behavior than those discovered with only hundreds or dozens. But the market is also broadening as large data sets become publicly available and data mining technologies become less expensive and more accessible to even those without a background in data analysis.

So, while data mining has traditionally been used in industries that generate a lot of data, such as in the credit card industry, health care or oil and gas exploration, it’s also gaining ground in education, customer relationship management and marketing, among many others.
