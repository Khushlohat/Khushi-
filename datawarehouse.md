## What is a data warehouse?
First, let's define what a data warehouse is and why you might want to use one for your organisation.

A data warehouse is a centralised repository that stores structured data (database tables, Excel sheets) and semi-structured data (XML files, webpages) for the purposes of reporting and analysis. The data flows in from a variety of sources, such as point-of-sale systems, business applications, and relational databases, and it is usually cleaned and standardised before it hits the warehouse. Because a data warehouse can store large amounts of information, it provides users with easy access to a wealth of historical data, which can be used for data mining, data visualisation, and other forms of business intelligence reporting.

## Benefits of data warehouse
Reliable data, especially when aggregated over time, helps users make smarter, more informed decisions about the way they run their organisation—and data warehouses are what makes that possible. The benefits of enterprise data warehousing are myriad, but some of the most impactful advantages include:
Data Warehouse
Data Warehouse is a relational database management system (RDBMS) construct to meet the requirement of transaction processing systems. It can be loosely described as any centralized data repository which can be queried for business benefits. It is a database that stores information oriented to satisfy decision-making requests. It is a group of decision support technologies, targets to enabling the knowledge worker (executive, manager, and analyst) to make superior and higher decisions. So, Data Warehousing support architectures and tool for business executives to systematically organize, understand and use their information to make strategic decisions.

Data Warehouse environment contains an extraction, transportation, and loading (ETL) solution, an online analytical processing (OLAP) engine, customer analysis tools, and other applications that handle the process of gathering information and delivering it to business users.
Using Data Warehouse Information
There are decision support technologies that help utilize the data available in a data warehouse. These technologies help executives to use the warehouse quickly and effectively. They can gather data, analyze it, and take decisions based on the information present in the warehouse. The information gathered in a warehouse can be used in any of the following domains −

## Tuning Production Strategies − The product strategies can be well tuned by repositioning the products and managing the product portfolios by comparing the sales quarterly or yearly.

## Customer Analysis − Customer analysis is done by analyzing the customer's buying preferences, buying time, budget cycles, etc.

## Operations Analysis − Data warehousing also helps in customer relationship management, and making environmental corrections. The information also allows us to analyze business operations.
# Benefits
A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:

Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.
Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
Maintain data history, even if the source transaction systems do not.
Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.
Improve data quality, by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
Present the organization's information consistently.
Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source.
Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the operational systems.
Add value to operational business applications, notably customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
Make decision–support queries easier to write.
Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.
Generic
## The environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:

Source systems that provide data to the warehouse or mart;
Data integration technology and processes that are needed to prepare the data for use;
Different architectures for storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts;
Different tools and applications for a variety of users;
Metadata, data quality, and governance processes must be in place to ensure that the warehouse or mart meets its purposes.
In regards to source systems listed above, R. Kelly Rainer states, "A common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases, which can be relational databases".[8]

Regarding data integration, Rainer states, "It is necessary to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse".[8]

Rainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts.

Metadata is data about data. "IT personnel need information about data sources; database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and data usage measures".[8]

Today, the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities. A key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers.[8] A "data warehouse" is a repository of historical data that is organized by the subject to support decision-makers in the organization.[8] Once data is stored in a data mart or warehouse, it can be accessed.
